scripts4OpenFOAM3rdParty
========================

This is an unofficial repository of auxiliary scripts for compiling 3rd Party dependencies for OpenFOAM(R).

It mostly serves as an auxiliary to the instructions pages provided here: http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Installation/Linux

Most of these scripts have been collected from this bug report: http://www.openfoam.org/mantisbt/view.php?id=220

This [git repository](https://github.com/wyldckat/scripts4OpenFOAM3rdParty/) was brought to you by Bruno Santos (wyldckat@github working at [blueCAPE Lda](www.bluecape.com.pt)).
